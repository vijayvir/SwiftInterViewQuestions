# Queue 

A queue is a list where you can only insert new items at the back and
  remove items from the front. This ensures that the first item you enqueue
  is also the first item you dequeue. First come, first serve!

  A queue gives you a ***FIFO*** or first-in, first-out order. The element you
  inserted first is also the first one to come out again. It's only fair!

  In this implementation, enqueuing is an O(1) operation as it have to add at last of the array , dequeuing is O(n) as it has to parse each elements of the queue.
  

  Functions used for the queue. 
  
   *  ***Enqueue*** Add elements at the end of queue. 
   *  ***Dequeue*** It remove the first element of the queue.
   *  ***Front*** Output the first elements of the queue. 
   
 
 # Stack  
 
   A stack is like an array but with limited functionality. You can only push
  to add a new element to the top of the stack, pop to remove the element from
  the top, and peek at the top element without popping it off.

  A stack gives you a **LIFO** or last-in first-out order. The element you pushed
  last is the first one to come off with the next pop.

  Push and pop are O(1) operations.
  
  * **Push** To append the element at top of the array 
  * **Pop** Removes and returns the last element of the collection.
  * **Top** or **peek** Returns the item at the top of the stack.
  
  
## Important points of swift 

  * Closure and Functions are reference type. 


### Inheritence 

* Convience 
* Desiginated 
* Required
